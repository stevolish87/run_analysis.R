Input Data

The script assumes the UCI dataset is extracted directly into the C drive of the user. See the README.md for further details.

Output Data

The tidy_data.txt dataset is the output of the script.  The data includes mean and standard deviation calculations for the following variables:

tBodyAcc
tGravityAcc
tBodyAccJerk
tBodyGyro
tBodyGyroJerk
tBodyAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc
fBodyAccJerk
fBodyGyro
fBodyAccMag
fBodyBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyBodyGyroMag
fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag. 

For every one of these variables, there is an X, Y, and Z calculation depending upon the direction of the movement.

The above variables where chosen by performing a search of variable names that included "mean" or "std" in their original variable names.

Transformations

The script, run_analysis.R, performs the following tasks,

1.  Loads all of the various data sets into R
2.  Merges all of the test data sets to their corresponding train data sets.       While doing this, applies appropriate headings.
3.  Creates a data set filtered by only mean and std variables.
4.  Computes the means of the smaller data set, grouped by subject     and activity.
5.  Saves this last data set on your computer and titles the file     "tidy_data.txt"
