# run_analysis.R
Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This project contains one R script, run_analysis.R.  This script will calculate means per activity and per subject of the mean and standard deviation of the data set "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0 [1]". This dataset should be downloaded and extracted directly into the data directory.

Once executed, the resulting dataset will be found at C:/Users/S0303025/Documents/R/data/tidy_data.txt

For details on how the script works, please see the attached Codebook.txt.

Required R Packages

The R package reshape2 is required to run this script. This package is automatically loaded in the script and can be installed using:

install.package("reshape2")
